> **My journey in DSA using https://www.takeuforward.com**
I am starting my journey in DSA after dwelling on internet for some time. make no mistake, there is no perfect course.
I learnt that its better to start somewhere. I choose Strivers A2Z DSA course for beginners becasue it made a lot of sense the way it is structured.
The course follows this path and my repo will be constantly get updated in the same manner.
